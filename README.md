# Module 11 Challenge 

This code uses BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to scrape Mars news and weather data and then uses Matplotlibs and Pandas to analyze the data.

## The assignment consists of two parts:
### Part_1 found at https://github.com/GeeksGhost/MarsData/blob/main/part_1_mars_news.ipynb
-- Part 1 scrapes news from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html and stores the information into a dictionary.

### Part_2 found at https://github.com/GeeksGhost/MarsData/blob/main/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb
-- Part 2 scrapes weather information from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. After sraping the data is then analyzed with Pandas and plotted with Matplotlibs.
  The data answers the following questions:
  1. How many months exist on Mars and how many data points were observed for each month
  2. How many days on Mars exists in the scraped dataset
  3. What the coldest and warmest months on Mars were from the location the data was collected
  4. What months on Mars have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure.
  5. How much Earth time(in days) elapses in the time it takes for Mars to make a full rotation around the sun.
 
-- The data is then saved into mars_weather.csv to be used in the future.
